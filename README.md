# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

This repository contains a command-line based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++. Players can choose between three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Hard.

## Game Features

- **Easy Mode:** The computer makes random moves, providing a casual and relaxed gameplay experience.
- **Normal Mode:** The computer plays more strategically, attempting to win if possible or blocking the player's winning moves, while still making occasional random moves.
- **Hard Mode:** The computer uses the Minimax algorithm to play optimally, ensuring a challenging and competitive game.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository and compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable to start the game.
3. Enter your Nickname.
4. Choose your character(X|Y).
5. Select the desired difficulty level by entering 1 (Easy), 2 (Normal), or 3 (Hard).
6. Take turns with the computer to make moves by entering the position (1-9) on the grid where you want to place your 'X'.
7. The game will display the updated board after each move, and it will continue until there's a winner or a draw.
